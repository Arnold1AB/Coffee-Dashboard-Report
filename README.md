# ‚òï Horizon Coffee Sales Dashboard

Beyond daily reporting, the **Horizon Coffee Dashboard** acts as a strategic compass for decision-making. By continuously tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), the team can uncover growth opportunities, detect inefficiencies early, and react quickly to market shifts.

## üéØ Project Objective
The Horizon Coffee Sales Dashboard helps the business see how well different roast types and package sizes sell, how much profit is earned, and which regions or customers drive revenue. It converts thousands of transactions into easy-to-read visuals that highlight trends, compare results, and reveal what works or does not. With just a few clicks, users can explore which roast sells best, which country brings in the most money, or which months are busiest for sales.

Managers, baristas, and decision makers get fast answers without digging through spreadsheets. The dashboard supports smarter choices about inventory, marketing focus, and pricing. Whether planning next quarter or reviewing last year‚Äôs results, it shines a light on the numbers that matter most.

## üß≠ Process Workflow
1. **Data Collection**  
   Exported raw order, product, and customer tables from the caf√© POS into CSV.

2. **Data Cleaning & Structuring**  
   Removed duplicates, fixed date formats, standardized country names, and filled in missing values.

3. **Data Aggregation**  
   The **Coffee Data Project ‚Äì Cleaned Datasets Orders** sheet was enriched with customer and product attributes, plus calculated metrics, using the following formulas (unchanged here for reference):

   | Purpose | Formula |
   |---------|---------|
   | **Return Customer Name** | `=XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$2:$A$1001,customers!$B$2:$B$1001,0)` |
   | **Return Customer Email** | `=IF(XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,,0)=0,"",XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,0))` |
   | **Return Customer Phone** | `=XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$2:$A$1001,customers!$G$2:$G$1001,0)` |
   | **Return Loyalty Card (Yes/No)** | `=XLOOKUP(orders!$C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$I$1:$I$1001,,0)` |
   | **Return Coffee Type Code** | `=INDEX(products!$A$1:$H$49,MATCH(orders!$D2,products!$A$1:$A$49,0),MATCH(orders!I$1,products!$A$1:$H$1,0))` |
   | **Return Roast Type Code** | `=INDEX(products!$A$1:$H$49,MATCH(orders!$D2,products!$A$1:$A$49,0),MATCH(orders!J$1,products!$A$1:$H$1,0))` |
   | **Sales (Value)** | *Quantity √ó Unit Price* |
   | **Profit (Value)** | *Unit Price √ó Price per 100 g* |
   | **Decode Coffee Type Name** | `=IF(I2="Rob","Robusta",IF(I2="Exc","Excelsa",IF(I2="Ara","Arabica",IF(I2="Lib","Liberica"))))` |
   | **Decode Roast Type Name** | `=IF(J2="M","Medium",IF(J2="L","Large",IF(J2="D","Dark","")))` |

4. **Dashboard Design**  
   The finished Excel dashboard combines several visual elements to keep insights clear and intuitive:

   | Visual Type | Purpose in the Dashboard |
   |-------------|--------------------------|
   | **Timeline slicer** | Interactive date filter lets users slide through years, quarters, or months and instantly update every chart. |
   | **Scorecards (KPI cards)** | Display single high-level numbers‚ÄîTotal Sales, Total Profit, Quantity Sold, and Profit Margin‚Äîso performance is clear at a glance. |
   | **Vertical bar chart** | Shows *Sales & Profit by Month* to reveal seasonal spikes and dips. |
   | **Horizontal bar chart** | Compares *Sales by Country* side-by-side, highlighting the United States outlier. |
   | **Line chart** | Plots *Total Sales Over Time* (separate colored lines for each coffee type) to expose long-term growth trends and product volatility. |

   A consistent coffee-brown palette and clear labels keep the visuals on brand and easy to interpret.

5. **User Interactivity**  
   - Slicers for date, roast type, size, and loyalty card allow quick drill-down.  
   - An interactive version of the dashboard is hosted on Google Drive: **[Coffee Data project ‚Äì Dashboard & Pivot Tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s6qi2ya9JtE3qqRXDyeL5gQdFMK9hRFF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104140290870922976550&rtpof=true&sd=true)**.  
     **Important:** download and open this file in **Excel 2013 or later**‚ÄîGoogle Sheets cannot render the timeline slicer, KPI scorecards, or pivot-table-driven charts correctly.
